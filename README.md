3D printer design for ultra fast and structural rigit toolhead

This design was heavily inspired by #. i liked found the take on how the 2 beam sesign made it possible to keep the belts length equal to 2* the axis. In addition the 2 beam design counters any issues regarding torsional loads to the Toolhead.

The main criteria:
- Fastest possible design without considering price
- Structural rigid toolhead for cnc machining
